# 🌀 Mouse Wiggle - An Alfred 5 for MacOS workflow

Keep your Mac awake with a gentle nudge — no more sleep interruptions during long downloads, meetings, or remote sessions.

This Alfred 5 workflow starts and stops a lightweight background process that moves your mouse cursor just enough to prevent your system from going idle.
